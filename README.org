* Intro

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Emacs is... what *you* want it to be.
#+END_QUOTE

This is a collection of files that I use to configure Emacs (versions >=27.1)
in accordance with my current needs and tastes.

This Emacs flavor is intended to be *well-organized*, *-documented*,
*-behaved*, and *good-looking*. A priority is given to the usage of the *built-in packages*,
but without usability sacrifice.

This configuration was mostly tested as a GUI application on Mac OS,
but it is expected to behave well on other operating systems too.

See also [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][this list of other configurations and starter-kits]] for a source of inspiration
to configure your own Emacs.


* Playing With This Repo

*** Install

- One, clone this configuration:
  - Backup contents of the directory =~/.emacs.d=, if you have the one.
  - ~$ git clone git@gitlab.com:yugaego/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d~
  - or ~$ git clone git@github.com:yugaego/emacs-config.git ~/.emacs.d~

- Two, install configured packages:
  - Open =install-packages.el= in Emacs.
  - Execute command ~M-x eval-buffer~.
  - Optionally, restart Emacs.


*** Structure

- init.el :: Main configuration file.
- early-init.el :: Configurations loaded very early in the startup process.
- custom.el :: Emacs Customization writes to this file. Read-only.
- configs/init-*.el :: Auto-loaded configuration files extracted from init.el
  for better readability.
- install-packages.el :: Install configured packages after cloning (on new devices).
- local-pre-init.el :: Private information can be stored in this file.\\
  This optional file is excluded from the repository
  and loaded only if present in the file system.
- examples/local-pre-init.el :: Example local configurations.
- local-post-init.el :: One more git-ignored optional file, loaded after
  ~configs/init-*.el~ files load.


* Getting Started with Emacs on Mac OS

With the listed types of installation you get a "pure" Emacs that behaves similarly to other OS applications.

For example, on Mac OS you may:
  - quit Emacs with =Cmd-q= or hide Emacs with =Cmd-h=,
  - perform well-known operations with =Cmd-c=, =Cmd-v=, =Cmd-a=, =Cmd-x=,
  - navigate text with the =arrows=.


*** Install

Tested with the Emacs versions 26.3, 27.1, 28.0.50.

Compiling from source is simple enough, so try starting with it.\\
Fallback to the pre-compiled binaries if you find it easier or are interested in a specific distribution with extras.


**** From source

- ~$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git YOUR-DIR~
- ~$ cd YOUR-DIR~
- ~$ ./configure~
- ~$ make~
  - Compiles emacs into =YOUR-DIR/src/=.
  - Launch install [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/68289258/1319821][emacs from CLI]].
- ~$ make install~
  - This is an optional step.
  - Adds Emacs.app to =YOUR-DIR/nextstep/=.
  - Feel free to move or symlink the created app.

For more details consult the files =YOUR-DIR/INSTALL=, =YOUR-DIR/nextstep/INSTALL=, and =YOUR-DIR/README=.


**** Pre-compiled

In both cases Emacs.app installed to =/Applications/=.

****** From dmg file

Download from [[https://emacsformacosx.com][EmacsForMacOSX]], install as any other application.

****** From brew

~$ brew cask install emacs~

- Upgrade: ~$ brew upgrade homebrew/cask/emacs~

- Info: ~$ brew cask info homebrew/cask/emacs~


[[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS][More on Mac OS installers]].

And by the way, Emacs usage is smooth with /Dvorak/ layout and a /split keyboard/.\\
I personally use [[https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/][Kinesis Advantage]] and feel comfortable having a set of modifier keys [[https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/1744636][under each of my hands]].


*** What's Next

As the next steps, I highly recommend:
  - following the /Emacs tutorial/ (~Ctrl-h t~),
  - then reading the /Emacs manual/ (~Ctrl-h r~).
I also found [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsNewbie][EmacsWiki]] to be the most helpful resource online.

Experiment while reading documentation. In my case, it took two months to read the manual and get comfortable with Emacs.\\
To that moment I wrote the simplest possible [[https://github.com/yugaego/emacs-config/blob/bare-bones/init.el][configuration file]] and wrote [[https://github.com/yugaego/cheat-sheets/blob/main/Emacs.org][this key bindings cheat sheet]].
